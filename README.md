## Hello! Thanks for coming along to my profile.
I'm slowly becoming an addict to coffee like [my dad](https://github.com/M1XZG).

I'm currently studying BSc (Hons) Software Engineering at Bournemouth University, hoping to become a Data Scientist (maybe I'll do a MSc.. haven't decided yet though). My favourite language is probably C# (because it’s the first language I learnt) and I really love SQL (I’ve been told I’m crazy, I’ll wear that badge with honour :)).

During my studies I've undertaken a variety of different roles (paid and voluntary) to enhance my skills:
1. Student Ambassador: I've had the opportunity to work with some amazing teams to broaden my capabilities:
- Open Days & Events: Provide comprehensive campus tours and detailed descriptions of buildings and features.
- Unibuddy: A platform where prospective students can chat to current students and ask questions about student life / perspective
- Schools Liaison Program: Collaborate with staff to organise safe and engaging campus visits for young students (ages 10-18).
- Future Students Enquiry Team: Offer well-informed advice to prospective students via email and phone.
- Digital Marketing: Creating content for the BU Blog page, I mostly discuss what it’s like to be a Computing student as well as a Society President.
2. Student Representative: being among other student reps, I’ve had the privilege of attending meetings and representing students’ voices
3. President of the Language Learning Society: I’m incredibly proud of the committee for not only creating a new society but maintaining the idea of creating a community to help improve people’s confidence in learning languages.
4. Soon to be PAL (Peer Assisted Learning) Leader for Technology Foundation:
- The foundation year option all Computing & Informatics department undergraduate course have that feed into the 8 courses on offer

Thank you for taking the time to read . Please enjoy my uploaded work and stay tuned for new works to come!
