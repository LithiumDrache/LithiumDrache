## Hello! Thanks for coming along to my profile. 🐉
☕ I'm slowly becoming a coffee addict like [my dad](https://github.com/M1XZG).

🎓 I'm currently studying BSc (Hons) Software Engineering at Bournemouth University, hoping to become a Data Scientist (maybe I'll do a MSc in Data Science 🤔). My favourite language is probably C# and I really love SQL (I’ve been told I’m crazy, I’ll wear that badge with honour >:)).

During my studies I've undertaken a variety of different roles (paid and voluntary) to enhance my skills:
1. 🌸 **Student Ambassador:** I've had the opportunity to work with some amazing teams to broaden my capabilities:
2. 📢 **Student Representative:** being among other student reps, I’ve had the privilege of attending meetings and representing students’ voices
3. 💬 **President of the Language Learning Society:** I’m incredibly proud of the committee for not only creating a new society but maintaining the idea of creating a community to help improve people’s confidence in learning languages.
4. 🔰 **PAL (Peer Assisted Learning) Leader for Technology Foundation:** where I conduct weekly sessions as a senior student with the Foundation year students, to help answer any questions they may have.

I'm attempting to use GitHub more, so expect my University coding to get uploaded here soon.

Thank you for taking the time to read about me. Please enjoy my uploaded work and stay tuned for new works to come!
